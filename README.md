Hello guys,

This is another guided project on Power BI from YouTube channel "Rishabh Mishra".

In this project rather than following every single step one by one, I tried to understand the details like objective of the analysis, tables/graphs required for the dashboard, slicers required and things like that. This helped me to understand the baseline of how a Power BI dashboard is drawn.
Similarly, I learned a lot more about Power BI like how to format visuals, which graph to use for which scenarios, how to plot the design for the dashboard, & many more things.

So overall, I would suggest beginner data analyst(like me) who are starting in Power BI to learn the basics from any YouTube channel (like "Alex the Analyst") and later start practicing with these projects & for interview related questions follow " Learn Wid Giggs".

So let's connect in GitHub & LinkedIn & deep-dive further into data to get the essence of it.
